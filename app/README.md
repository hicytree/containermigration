## How to Run the App

1. Install the `serve` package globally by running the following command:

   ```shell
   npm install -g serve
   ```

2. Start the server by running the following command:

   ```shell
   serve
   ```

   This will serve your app on a local development server.

3. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the app.

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed before running these commands.
